In this project, I created a personal website using GitHub Pages. The website showcases my skills, projects, and interests, and provides a hub for my online presence.

The website includes a homepage with a brief introduction and links to my social media profiles, as well as separate pages for my skills, projects, and blog. The skills page lists my technical skills and relevant certifications, while the projects page highlights some of my favorite projects and provides links to their GitHub repositories.

The blog page features articles on various topics related to my interests, such as technology, data science, and personal development. The blog posts are written in Markdown and are formatted using Jekyll templates, which provide a clean and consistent look and feel throughout the website.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, and Jekyll, and shows how these skills can be applied to create a professional and engaging personal website.
